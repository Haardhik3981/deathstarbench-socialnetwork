# Kubernetes Deployment for User Service (DeathStarBench)
#
# WHAT THIS DOES:
# This deployment manages the User microservice pods from DeathStarBench.
# The User service handles user account operations (create, read, update profiles).
#
# KEY POINTS:
# - Uses the DeathStarBench unified image with entrypoint: UserService
# - Connects to user-mongodb and user-memcached
# - All services run on port 9090 (Thrift protocol)
# - Requires config volume mount for service-config.json
