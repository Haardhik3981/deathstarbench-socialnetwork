# Kubernetes Deployment for Nginx-Thrift Gateway (DeathStarBench)
#
# WHAT THIS DOES:
# DeathStarBench uses nginx-thrift (OpenResty with Thrift support) as the API gateway.
# This gateway handles HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate Thrift microservices.
# It's different from regular nginx - it supports Thrift protocol for service communication.
#
# KEY POINTS:
# - Uses OpenResty (nginx + Lua) with Thrift support
# - Routes HTTP requests to Thrift microservices
# - Requires Lua scripts and configuration from DeathStarBench
# - Exposes port 8080 for HTTP API access
#
# NOTE: This deployment requires files from DeathStarBench source:
# - nginx-web-server/lua-scripts/
# - nginx-web-server/pages/
# - nginx-web-server/conf/nginx.conf
# - nginx-web-server/jaeger-config.json
# - gen-lua/
# - docker/openresty-thrift/lua-thrift/
